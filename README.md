## 📜 History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in **1995** during his time at **Netscape Communications**. Initially developed in just **10 days**, JavaScript was originally named **Mocha**, then renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally to **JavaScript**. The name change was a marketing strategy to capitalize on the popularity of **Java**, another programming language at the time.

JavaScript was designed to be a **lightweight scripting language** for web pages, enabling **dynamic content** and **interactive user experiences**. It quickly gained popularity and became an essential part of web development.

In **1997**, JavaScript was standardized by the **European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)** as **ECMAScript**. The first edition of ECMAScript (**ES1**) was published in **June 1997**. Over the years, several versions of ECMAScript have been released, introducing new features and improvements to the language. Some notable versions include:

- **ES3 (1999):** Added regular expressions, better string handling, and new control statements.
- **ES5 (2009):** Introduced strict mode, JSON support, and new array methods.
- **ES6 (2015):** Also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015, this version brought significant changes, including classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, and more.
- **ES7 (2016) and beyond:** Continued to add new features and improvements, such as async/await, new array methods, and more.

Today, JavaScript is one of the most **widely used programming languages** in the world, powering **millions of websites** and web applications.
