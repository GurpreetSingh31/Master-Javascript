# Getting Started with JavaScript

## Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling backend development with JavaScript.

### Who Created Node.js?
Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. It has since evolved into a powerful tool for server-side development.

## Evolution of JavaScript: From V8 Engine to Node.js
- **V8 Engine**: Developed by Google, the V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine that compiles JavaScript to native machine code.
- **Node.js**: Leveraging the V8 engine, Node.js extends JavaScript capabilities to server-side development, allowing for full-stack JavaScript applications.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Downloading Node.js
To get started with Node.js, you need to download and install it on your machine.Node.js is a runtime enviornment which allow your Javascript code can directly run on your machine, now a days many options are available in the market like deno , bun and you can feel free to download those options 
but the traditional way is node.js , in this repo both option is discussed

#### For macOS:
1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the macOS installer.
3. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.
4. Verify the installation by opening Terminal and typing:
                   ```sh
                   node -v
                   npm -v
                   ```

#### For Windows:
1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the Windows installer.
3. Run the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the installation instructions.
4. Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
                   ```sh
                   node -v
                   npm -v
                   ```

## Choosing an IDE
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can greatly enhance your productivity. Here are some popular choices:
- **Visual Studio Code**: A free, open-source IDE with excellent JavaScript support.
- **WebStorm**: A powerful IDE specifically designed for JavaScript development.
- **Sublime Text**: A lightweight and fast text editor with JavaScript support.

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Using Homebrew (macOS)
You can install Node.js and its alternatives using Homebrew:

```sh
# Install Node.js
brew install node

# Install Deno (A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript)
brew install deno

# Install Bun (A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime)
brew install bun

# Install Fresh (Another JavaScript runtime)
brew install fresh
```

### Version Managers
For better Node.js version management:

```sh
# Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
brew install nvm

# Install fnm (Fast Node Manager)
brew install fnm
```

Note: Make sure you have Homebrew installed before running these commands. To install Homebrew:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
